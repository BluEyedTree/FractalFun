Running FractalFun will create a GUI that will allow you to choose a Fractal to draw, and the color that fractal should be drawn in. Once a Fractal is made the button in the top left corner will make the Fractal Algorithm run +1 iteration, thus growing the fractal seen on the screen. The Factory method is used to create the desired Fractal type and color. 

The idea for the Tree fractal design was obtained from this giithub:
