Fractal Fun is a little project I put together to play around with JavaFX. The main file to run is FractalFun.Java. This loads up a menu where the color, and type of fractal can be selected. 

After selection, another screen is opened. In this new screen you can click the button in the upperleft and this will run the fractal algorithm one greater round and recursion, hence producing the nest layer of the tree. 

The design implements the Factory method with the FractalFactory Class. In order to expand on the work, you must hard code (I know not the best design) a new button to the menu. Then, create a new Fractal that extends Fractal Shape. Then add the appropriate code in FractalFactory to create your new Fractal!
